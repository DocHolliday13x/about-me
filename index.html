    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <img id = "hero" src="img/TulipFestival.jpg">

    <p>Hey there, friend! I'm Ryan, and if you would like to know a little more about me then stick around and check out
        my webpage. I'm a United States Navy Veteran, and I served from 2009 to 2013. I took my honorable discharge then
        returned home to the panhandle of Idaho where I putzed around pretty much up until now. Somehow I landed myself
        a beautiful wife who is an Emergency Department Nurse, and together we have the cutest baby girl who is
        currently a toddler in her "WHY?" phase, which is... well, it's a hoot. I have certifications in a few different
        fields, such as pre-apprentice Lineman, Emergency Medical Technician, Certified Nursing Assistant, First-Aid,
        and Healthcare Provider CPR/AED. I'm currently studying full-stack software development with CodeFellows and
        working towards becoming a Software Developer.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>I have several small goals that I am currently working towards. But for the sake of discussion, my five year
            plan will hopefully result in me becoming extremely proficient with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I will land a
            position at a company that reflects values that I hold of high importance. I will continue to improve myself
            to be the best husband and father that I can be!</p>
