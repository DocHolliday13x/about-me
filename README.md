#### Reflections

This assignment took me waaaaay longer than it should have. CSS is certainly not my strong suit. I basically read the entire WS3 page on CSS elements just to make my website look the way it does, which is currently not good. But at least my lighthouse score is 100 so I've got that going for me.
